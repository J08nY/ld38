    "text": "The ultimate guide for any beginner but also experienced planet builder!\nCovers all the bases, even the orthonormal ones.\n\nYou definitely need some solid base, to create the planet's core, mantle and crust. If you want to have a chance at creating life, gaseous elements for your planet's atmosphere are a must have! You could also try to create a gaseous planet, or anything else really, if spaghetti monsters are your thing.\n\nBuy resources from the Multiverse shop, they have everything you will need to make a planet. Usually sold in batches of sextillion tons.\n\nAfter combining your planet in the Combinator, go to the Incubator and evolve your planet/s. Some challenges may face you there, as not every step in planet's evolution is in the right direction. Evolving life in highest possible form is what will satisfy your customers.\n\nThen move your planet to the Exporter for potential buyers.\n\nThe more advanced life you evolve on your planets the more you get for them.\n",
